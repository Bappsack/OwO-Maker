### Notes

Back in 2020 i made [UwU Maker](https://github.com/Bappsack/UwU-Maker) out of boredom and never really worked on it again, it was based on pixel/image detection and worked fine for the most people but it was slow and didn't supported all games. 
Now i'm sitting here again having nothing better todo so i decided to port it over to be memory based and thought it would be better to have a seperate repo for this.

Thanks to [morsisko](https://github.com/morsisko) for his [Sawmill Bot](https://github.com/morsisko/SawmillBot) Structs.
